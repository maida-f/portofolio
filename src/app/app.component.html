      <h2>MAIDA FILIPOVIĆ</h2>
<p>My name is Maida Filipović. I am a third-year student of Computer Science at the Sarajevo School of Science and Technology. I finished two elementary schools and high school- Gymnasium "Mahmut Bušatlija" in Bugojno. Two elementary schools include one regular and the other music elementary school. I  went to music school for 8 years and I play guitar. When I meet someone I like to point out a fun fact about myself, and that is: I remember the numbers very well. Proof of this fun fact is that I won first place in the competition "Memorizing decimal of number pi", where I memorized 546 decimal places pi.</p>
    <br>
<p>I started working in NGOs in elementary school and the first was Red Cross. As part of the Red Cross, there was the First Aid competition, where I participated in national competitions and achieved extraordinary results. At the beginning of the faculty, I joined the IAESTE organization, which is in charge of providing internships for students around the world. In the IAESTE organization, I was the Outgoing Coordinator for students in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I always say that volunteering is my hobby and that it is my favorite hobby. A hobby that has brought me so much knowledge, experience and met extraordinary people.
</p>
      <br>
      <p>Another hobby that has been current since October 2021 is boxing. Out of pure curiosity, I joined Boxing Club Željezničar, and now it is a great interest and love for this sport.</p>
